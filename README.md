This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to write to a memory location that doesn't exist. The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version that avoids this error.  Null pointer dereferences can cause crashes and unpredictable behavior in your program, so it's essential to check for null pointers before dereferencing them.
